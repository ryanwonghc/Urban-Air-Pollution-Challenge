# Urban-Air-Pollution-Challenge
iXperience Purple Class Project Team 2

## Objective
To predict PM2.5 particulate matter concentration in the air every day for each city in the dataset. PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers and is one of the most harmful air pollutants. PM2.5 is a common measure of air quality that normally requires ground-based sensors to measure.

## Data
Data was obtained from the [Urban Air Pollution Challenge on Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions/zindiweekendz-learning-urban-air-pollution-challenge/data). The dataset contains measurements of data useful for assessing air quality (atmospheric concentrations of ozone, methane, etc.) obtained by the Sentinel-5P satellite. The data covers measurements from Jan 2020 - Mar 2020 and spans hundreds of cities across the globe.
