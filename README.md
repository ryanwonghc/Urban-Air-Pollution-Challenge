# Urban-Air-Pollution-Challenge
iXperience Purple Class Project Team 2

## Objective
To predict PM2.5 particulate matter concentration in the air every day for each city in the dataset. PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers.  PM2.5 is the main particulate matter in air pollution and is linked to lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and metabolic disease. Predicting PM2.5 concentrations can aid the government with their pollution control efforts and protect at risk populations from pollution related sicknesses

## Data
Data was obtained from the [Urban Air Pollution Challenge on Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions/zindiweekendz-learning-urban-air-pollution-challenge/data). The dataset contains measurements of data useful for assessing air quality (atmospheric concentrations of ozone, methane, etc.) obtained by the Sentinel-5P satellite. The data covers measurements from Jan 2020 - Mar 2020 and spans hundreds of cities across the globe.
